# Overview

This Emacs package provides a utility to generate out-of-line method implementations for C++ classes.
It leverages [Tree Sitter](https:tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) for accurate parsing of C++ declarations
directly from header files.

Place your cursor on a C++ method declaration inside a header file, run the command,
and the function body will be automatically generated and inserted in the corresponding source (.cpp) file.

Templated methods are fully supported.

Version: 0.1.2

> [!CAUTION]
> I am new to Emacs Lisp and this plugin is still in early stages and it might not work all the time.
> Please open an issue if there are any problems.

# Demo

1. Implement function at point

- Regular functions

![img](images/regular.gif)

- Templated functions

![img](images/templated.gif)

2. Implement all methods from a class

![img](images/implement-all.gif)

3. Implement selected methods from a class

![img](images/implement-selected.gif)

4. Implement methods from highlighted region

![img](images/highlight.gif)

5. Create concrete class from another class

# Features

+ Implement all the methods in a class
+ Implement function at point
+ Implement selected function(s)
+ Implement methods from highlighted region
+ Implement concrete class from a given class
+ Skip header-only method declarations from implementation (only in implement all methods command):
  + `inline`
  + `constexpr`
  + `consteval`
  + `constinit`
+ Skip `delete` and `default` methods (only in implement all methods command)

> [!NOTE]
> Concrete class are ordinary classes that can be instantiated and have no virtual functions.

# Requirements

-   Emacs 29+ with Tree-sitter support.
-   C++ major mode using Tree-sitter backend (\`c++-ts-mode\`).
-   A valid project structure with corresponding \`.cpp\` files discoverable via \`ff-find-other-file\`.

# Installation

Use VC with use-package

```elisp
(use-package cpp-func-impl
    :vc (cpp-func-impl :url "https://github.com/dheerajshenoy/cpp-func-impl")
    :commands
    (cpp-func-impl-implement
    cpp-func-impl-implement-all
    cpp-func-impl-implement-selected
    cpp-func-impl-implement-region
    cpp-func-impl-implement-dwim
    cpp-func-impl-concrete-class)
    :custom
    (cpp-func-impl-comment-string "// TODO: `%m` `%d` `%t` `%c`"))
```

or clone the repo and load it manually

```elisp
(use-package cpp-func-impl
    :load-path "<path-to-cloned-directory>"
    :commands
    (cpp-func-impl-implement
    cpp-func-impl-implement-all
    cpp-func-impl-implement-selected
    cpp-func-impl-implement-region
    cpp-func-impl-implement-dwim
    cpp-func-impl-concrete-class)
    :custom
    (cpp-func-impl-comment-string "// TODO: `%m` `%d` `%t` `%c`"))
```


# Commands

You have the following commands that can be invoked:

+ `cpp-func-impl-implement` - Implements the method at point.
+ `cpp-func-impl-implement-selected` - Implements selected methods from a class.
+ `cpp-func-impl-implement-all` - Implements all the method inside the class (assuming the point is inside the class).
+ `cpp-func-impl-implement-region` - Implements all methods inside the region.

    > [!NOTE]
    > when using `cpp-func-impl-implement-region` make sure that the highlighted region contains
    > methods from one class/struct only. Otherwise it may lead to unexpected function
    > implementations.

+ `cpp-func-impl-implement-dwim` - Implements methods in a DWIM (do what I mean) fashion.

    If there is active highlight region, then implement methods from the highlighted region,
    else implement the method at point.

+ `cpp-func-impl-concrete-class` - Creats a concrete class of the class where the point lies inside.



If you call the commands with a prefix argument a comment is inserted.
This comment can be changed by setting the variable
`cpp-func-impl-comment-string`.

# Customizations

You can customize the comment inserted into the implementation body by setting the variable `cpp-func-impl-comment-string`.

## `cpp-func-impl-comment-string`

The comment string can include valid format specifiers mentioned below which get injected with information like `method-name`, `class-name`, `time`, `date`.

Following format specifiers are supported:

| Format Specifier | Meaning      |
|------------------|--------------|
| %c               | Class Name   |
| %m               | Method Name  |
| %t               | Current Time |
| %d               | Current Date |

Example:

```elisp
  (setopt cpp-func-impl-comment-string "// TODO: Implement `%m` for the class `%c. Added at `%t` on `%d`")
```

# Limitations

-   Does not support auto-discovery of already existing method definition.
